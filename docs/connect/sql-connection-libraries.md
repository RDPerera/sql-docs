# Connection modules for Microsoft SQL Database

This article provides download links to connection modules or *drivers* that your client programs can use for interacting with [Databases](../relational-databases/databases/databases.md), [Azure SQL Database](/azure/sql-database/), and Azure SQL Managed Instance. Drivers are available for a variety of programming languages, running on the following operating systems:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows

**OOP-to-relational mismatch:**

*Relational*: Client programs that are written in an object-oriented programming (OOP) language often use SQL drivers, which return queried data in a format that is more relational than object oriented. C# using ADO.NET is one example. The OOP-relational format mismatch sometimes makes the OOP code harder to write and understand.

*ORM*: Other drivers or frameworks return queried data in the OOP format, avoiding the mismatch. These drivers work by expecting that classes have been defined to match the data columns of particular SQL tables. The driver then performs the *object-relational mapping* (ORM) to return queried data as an instance of a class. Microsoft's Entity Framework (EF) for C#, and Hibernate for Java, are two examples.

The present article devotes separate sections to these two kinds of connection drivers.
